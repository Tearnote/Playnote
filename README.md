# Playnote

A hobby project for a stable, modern and intuitive [BMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be-Music_Source) player, written in modern C++.
Work in progress.

## Milestones

  - Plays it back directly via [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) with minimal latency
  - Basic Imgui playback controls
